This Tableau visualization consists of two charts showcasing sales data over time.

	•	Top Chart: A dual-axis chart combines a bar chart and line chart. The bar chart represents the total sales over the years, with the red bars indicating the sales amount. The line chart displays other measures such as profit, quantity, and unit price over the same time period. The red bars show an increasing trend in sales from 2018 to 2022.
	•	Bottom Chart: This chart focuses on the count of orders (Orders.csv) and provides a detailed breakdown of sales per year. The green bars represent the count of orders, with orange labels highlighting the exact count, and the vertical axis shows the quantity.

The combination of these charts provides a comprehensive view of sales performance, order count, and other metrics over the selected time period.
